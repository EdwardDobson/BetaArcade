SLIME TIME

SLIME TIME is a four player couch co-op game with several different game modes such as TRON, King of the Hill and Hot Potato.
The was developed for my third year university course in a group of 8 including myself. Our group consisted of Artists, Designers and Programmers.

MY CONTRIBUTION

The King of the Hill and Hot Potato game mode were both developed by me. I also created the playlist/loading system as well as all of the UI systems.
